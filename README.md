# Light Up Diyas This Diwali ðŸª”âœ¨

Light Up Diyas This Diwali is an interactive web project that celebrates the essence of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. This project brings this spirit to life by allowing users to "light" virtual diyas (lamps) with a simple click. Itâ€™s a small, digital way to participate in the festival and honor its values.

## About Diwali
Diwali, also known as ```Deepavali```, is one of the most celebrated festivals in India and among Indian communities worldwide. It is usually celebrated in October or November. The day of Deepavali is marked by lighting oil lamps, known as diyas, and creating a festive atmosphere with colorful lights, sweets, and gatherings. The light of the diya symbolizes hope, positivity, and the triumph of good over evil.

## The Story Behind Deepavali
The celebration of Deepavali has roots in ancient Hindu legends, and its significance varies across regions. One of the most popular stories comes from the epic, ```The Ramayan```.

## The Return of Lord Ram 
Deepavali marks the return of Lord Ram to his kingdom of Ayodhya after 14 years in exile. During this period, Ram, accompanied by his wife Sita and brother Lakshman, faced many challenges, including the battle against the demon king Ravan, who had kidnapped Sita. Ram ultimately defeated Ravan, symbolizing the victory of righteousness and virtue. The people of Ayodhya celebrated his return by lighting lamps, which is why Deepavali is called the Festival of Lights.

## Symbolism of Lighting Diyas
Lighting diyas during Deepavali is symbolic of removing spiritual darkness and illuminating the path of wisdom and hope. Each diya represents the inner light that protects us from spiritual darkness. As we light up our homes, we invite positivity, prosperity, and blessings into our lives.

### About the Project
Light Up Diyas This Diwali recreates the spirit of the festival digitally. Each diya (represented as a small circle on the webpage) can be lit up with a click, symbolizing the joy of spreading light. You can engage with the diyas, turning them on and off, as a reminder of the power of light and goodness.
